Advancing Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Deep Learning-Based AI for Automated Histopathological Tissue Scoring for

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This application uses transfer learning with pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) — **VGG19**, **InceptionNet**, and **AlexNet** — to classify immunohistochemically stained breast cancer tissue into 4 categories based on HER2 expression:
- **0+** (Benign)
- **1+** (Normal)
- **2+** (In-Situ)
- **3+** (Malignant)

A custom MATLAB-based GUI provides model selection, performance visualization, and evaluation of classification outcomes.

## 🛠️ Features

- MATLAB GUI with interactive navigation
- Preprocessing and dataset loading automation
- Transfer learning using VGG19, ResNet-50, GoogLeNet
- Confusion matrix generation and accuracy/precision/recall/F1-score computation
- Heatmap and misclassified sample visualization
- Evaluation against validation/test datasets
- Learning rate tuning (control: `0.0005`, optimized: `0.00025`)

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model       | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| VGG19       | 90%      | 89%       | 90%    | 89%      |
| Inception   | **91%**  | 91%       | 91%    | 90%      |
| AlexNet     | 88%      | 87%       | 88%    | 87%      |

*Note: Best performance was achieved with a learning rate of `0.00025`.*
